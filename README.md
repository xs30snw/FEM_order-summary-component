## My process

### What I learned

I tried to complete this challenge on my own, while only googling for CSS properties or using the knowledge I already had. Whereas I'm sure that the initial solution is not optimal, it will be useful to compare this with others' work.

The biggest problem was to understand how the form should cast shadow on the background, because I couldn't implement it with any of the given colors.
